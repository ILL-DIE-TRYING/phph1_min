/**
* This file contains all the settings required to invoke the PHPH1 class
* The config.php should be included in your project (or the settings in your project's configuration file) before invoking the PHPH1 class
*
* Be sure to look below the doc block in the inc/config.php settings for examples.
*
* Settings:
*
* $phph1_apiaddresses - This is a multi-dimensional array that holds the node and shard information. By default this array contains the official Harmony nodes but you can comment them out and add your own personal nodes as shown where the array is set. if you do add your own node address, be sure to also set $default_network and $default_shard as well
*
* $default_network - Sets the default network (also the network used by the rpc script). It MUST use a network listed in the $phph1_apiaddresses array. For example by default it is set to use "mainnet".
*
* $default_shard - Sets the default shard (also the shard used by the rpc script). It MUST use a shard listed in the $phph1_apiaddresses array. For example by default it is set to use "0".
*
* $default_pagesize - The default page size for methods that return multiple pages of data
*
* $max_pagesize - This is the maximum number of items per page when a method returns multiple pages of data. This prevents a client from reuesting large datasets in a single call which will put a heavy load on the web server.
